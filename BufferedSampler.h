/*! \brief Ringbuffer-based sampler for analog values
 *
 * This class keeps a fixed number of samples in a ring buffer, enabling 
 * calculation of minimum(), maximum(), average() (mean) values. 
 *
 * Advantages:
 *   - calculates actual mean value for samples in buffer
 *   - provides minimum() and maximum() values for values in buffer
 *
 * Disadvantages:
 *   - memory usage increases with number of samples
 *   - takes longer to calculate than exponential moving average

     * \param pin the analog input pin to read samples from
     * \param periodMs the number of milliseconds between samples.  If update() is called
     *        before periodMs has passed since the last update(), no sample will be taken.
     * \param samples the number of samples to keep in the ring buffer used to calculate
     *        average(), minimum() and maximum().
     *
     * Note: this class dynamically allocated memory for the ring buffer.
