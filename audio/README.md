# Audio Files

These audio files are for use with the DFPlayerMini and DFPReader classes. To use them with a DFPlayer Mini device, copy them to a DOS/FAT formatted micro-SD card and put them in a directory named *mp3*.

The following files are just examples to play with which are known to work with the DFPlayer Mini. They were encoded using [Lame](http://lame.sourceforge.net/).

```
0001-example-1-ring.mp3
0002-example-2-off-hook.mp3
0003-example-3-trunk-signal.mp3
```

When adding your own audio files, ensure the filenames following the same naming convention (starting with a four-digit integer with zero-padding).

The rest of the files (beginning with *02*) are for use with the DFPReader class, which uses them to read out numbers.
