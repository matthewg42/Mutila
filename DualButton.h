/*! \brief Single button object responding to two inputs
 *
 * DualButton acts like a single button, but will respond to input
 * from one of two separate DebouncedButtons on different pins and
 * potentially with different pin logic. This makes it easy to have
 * a second input (e.g. wired button and FM button) whilst 
 * maintaining the clean syntax of a single button object in your
 * sketch.
