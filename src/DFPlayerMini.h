/*! \brief Easy-to-use controller class for DFPlayer Mini devices
 *
 * This class implements some of the functionality of the 
 * DFPlayer_Mini_MP3 library, to control a DFPlayer Mini device.
 * It includes features which were not yet implemented in the 
 * DFPlayer_Mini_MP3 at time of writing, namely a mechanism to 
 * receive results of query calls to the device.
 *
 * The device is expected to be connected using serial and optionally
 * the BUSY line.  Serial comms are at 9600 baud.  The BUSY line is
 * pulled to ground when the DFPlayerMini device is playing an mp3
 * file.
