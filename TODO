Work to do in deal-with-millis-wrap branch b4 merge

General cleanup / consistency making:
- make sure all pins are const in member and constructor params
- convert all int to int16_t and similar
- some attention to Doxygen brief / param tags
- use consts instead of #defines when possible
- use CamelCase global names and for consts
- Consolidate DebounedButton and DebouncedAnalogButton using inheritance
